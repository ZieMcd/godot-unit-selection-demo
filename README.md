# godot-unit-selection-demo

Testing a unit selection type system for a potential up coming project.
Demo is made in Godot and makes use of the following 
- [NavigationMesh](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_navigationmesh.html#class-navigationmesh) & [NavMeshAgents](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_navigationagent3d.html)
- [Camera3D's unproject_position](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_camera3d.html#class-camera3d-method-unproject-position) for selection

Project is pretty unorganised but most of logic is in palyer_interface.gd
